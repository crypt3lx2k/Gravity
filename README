The camera has two modes, free and focus.

It defaults to free mode, in free mode you can move the camera with the wasd/arrow-keys.
In focus mode it fixes on a particle, in focus mode you can switch which particle to focus on with the wasd/arrow-keys.

To switch between modes use the f key.

The plus key makes the simulation timestep larger and the minus key makes the simulation timestep smaller.
This will speed up or slow down the physical processes respectively.

To reset and get a new simulation use the r button.

To quit press the esc or q buttons.
