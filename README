A simple nbody simulation.

Compile by running the commands
$ cd src/
src/ $ make

To compile with a specific solver (in this instance code using CUDA) run the commands
$ cd src/
src/ $ make physics-verlet-brute-cuda

Run by running the commands
src/ $ ../bin/nbody

For Fedora/CentOS/RedHat nbody requires,
fontconfig-devel
dSFMT-devel

The SDL visualizer requires
SDL-devel
SDL_gfx-devel
SDL_image-devel
SDL_ttf-devel

The SDL2-OpenGL visualizer requires
SDL2-devel
SDL2_image-devel
SDL2_ttf-devel
glew-devel
Something that provides */libGL.*, typically mesa-devel or GPU drivers.

The CUDA and Hybrid physics solvers require a CUDA-C compiler.

The OpenMP, SSE-OpenMP, AVX-OpenMP and Hybrid physics solvers require a C compiler that supports OpenMP.

The camera has two modes, free and focus.

It defaults to free mode, in free mode you can move the camera with the wasd/arrow-keys.
In focus mode it fixes on a particle, in focus mode you can switch which particle to focus on with the wasd/arrow-keys.

To switch between modes use the f key.

The plus key makes the simulation timestep larger and the minus key makes the simulation timestep smaller.
This will speed up or slow down the physical processes respectively.
Note that a too large timestep will lead to numerical instability and unrealistic results.

The b key will reverse the direction of time.
Unless the timestep is otherwise altered with the + and - keys this will be a faithful replay.

To reset and get a new simulation use the r button.

To zoom in use the z key and to zoom out use the x key.

To quit press the esc or q buttons.

OLD SDL VISUALIZER ONLY:
To toggle particle trails (useful at small numbers of particles) press the t button.
